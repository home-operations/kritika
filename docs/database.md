# Postgres with CloudNativePG

kritika keeps everything it knows in one Postgres database: reviews, findings,
the job queue, transcripts and the similar-code index. This page sets that
database up with [CloudNativePG](https://cloudnative-pg.io/docs/1.30/) (CNPG).
Any Postgres that meets the requirements below works; CNPG is what the
examples use.

## What kritika needs

- **Postgres 18 with VectorChord.** The `vchord`
  ([VectorChord](https://github.com/tensorchord/VectorChord)) and `vector`
  (pgvector, whose types it builds on) extensions must exist before the first
  start, and `vchord` must be in `shared_preload_libraries`.
- **Three roles**, which the chart requires and kritika checks at start:
    - the **owner** runs migrations and applies the configuration on the
      leader. It owns the database, and kritika refuses one that is a
      superuser;
    - the **application** role (`database.app.role`, `kritika_app` by
      default) serves everything else. kritika refuses one that owns a
      table, is a superuser or has `BYPASSRLS`, any of which would turn
      row-level security off;
    - the **runner** role (`database.runner.role`, `kritika_runner` by
      default) is handed to runner Jobs and can only write its own run.
- **Direct or session-mode connections** for the owner and application
  roles. The leader is whichever replica holds a session advisory lock on its
  owner connection, and the dashboard's live updates and the job queue's
  notifications `LISTEN` on the application connection. A transaction-mode
  pooler, such as PgBouncer or a CNPG `Pooler` with `poolMode: transaction`,
  hands a session to other clients between transactions, which breaks both.

## The cluster

CNPG's own `standard` image ships pgvector, and VectorChord mounts into it
from TensorChord's
[`vchord-scratch`](https://docs.vectorchord.ai/vectorchord/admin/kubernetes.html)
image as an
[image volume extension](https://cloudnative-pg.io/docs/1.30/imagevolume_extensions/).
Two instances with synchronous replication keep every committed write through
a failover:

```yaml
apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: kritika-postgres
spec:
  instances: 2
  imageName: ghcr.io/cloudnative-pg/postgresql:18.6-standard-bookworm
  enableSuperuserAccess: false
  postgresql:
    extensions:
      - name: vchord
        image:
          reference: ghcr.io/tensorchord/vchord-scratch:pg18-v1.1.1
        # The image keeps Debian's paths rather than CNPG's default
        # /extensions/vchord/lib and /extensions/vchord/share.
        dynamic_library_path:
          - /usr/lib/postgresql/18/lib/
        extension_control_path:
          - /usr/share/postgresql/18/
    shared_preload_libraries:
      - vchord
    # A commit waits for the standby while it is healthy, so a failover
    # loses nothing; with the standby down, writes go on without it.
    synchronous:
      method: any
      number: 1
      dataDurability: preferred
  primaryUpdateStrategy: unsupervised
  # Update the standby first, then switch over to it, rather than restart
  # the primary in place.
  primaryUpdateMethod: switchover
  affinity:
    podAntiAffinityType: required
  storage:
    size: 10Gi
  bootstrap:
    initdb:
      database: kritika
      owner: kritika
      secret:
        name: kritika-postgres-credentials
```

- Image volume extensions need Kubernetes 1.35 (or 1.33 and 1.34 with the
  `ImageVolume` feature gate on) and containerd 2.1 or CRI-O 1.31. Without
  them, use TensorChord's
  [`cloudnative-vectorchord`](https://github.com/tensorchord/cloudnative-vectorchord)
  image instead, which has VectorChord built in and is tagged
  `<postgres>-<vchord>` (`18.6-1.1.1`), and leave out `extensions`.
- `dataDurability: preferred` relaxes the synchronous requirement while the
  standby is unavailable. `required` would block writes instead.
- `primaryUpdateMethod: switchover` rejects an update that changes the image
  and the Postgres parameters at once; apply them one at a time.
- `podAntiAffinityType: required` keeps the two instances on different nodes.
  CNPG's default, `preferred`, lets them share one when the scheduler finds
  no other, and then that node takes both down.
- Each instance has its own volume and Postgres replicates between them, so
  the storage class need not replicate as well: a node-local one is enough.
- The bootstrap owner, `kritika`, is the owner role.

A `Database` resource creates the extensions. The operator runs it as
superuser, so the owner never needs that privilege. `vchord`'s `version` is
the one CNPG installs, or updates the extension to when it changes, so move it
with the `vchord-scratch` tag:

```yaml
apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1
kind: Database
metadata:
  name: kritika
spec:
  cluster:
    name: kritika-postgres
  name: kritika
  owner: kritika
  extensions:
    - name: vector
      ensure: present
    - name: vchord
      version: "1.1.1"
      ensure: present
```

The application and runner roles are `DatabaseRole` resources, which CNPG
recommends over the Cluster's `managed.roles`
([declarative role management](https://cloudnative-pg.io/docs/1.30/declarative_role_management/)).
kritika's migrations grant them what they need:

```yaml
apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1
kind: DatabaseRole
metadata:
  name: kritika-app
spec:
  cluster:
    name: kritika-postgres
  name: kritika_app
  login: true
  passwordSecret:
    name: kritika-postgres-app
  # Deleting this resource leaves the role, so a running kritika keeps its
  # connections.
  databaseRoleReclaimPolicy: retain
---
apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1
kind: DatabaseRole
metadata:
  name: kritika-runner
spec:
  cluster:
    name: kritika-postgres
  name: kritika_runner
  login: true
  passwordSecret:
    name: kritika-postgres-runner
  databaseRoleReclaimPolicy: retain
```

## Secrets and connection URIs

Each role's password Secret is a `kubernetes.io/basic-auth` Secret with
`username` and `password`, as CNPG expects. The chart reads a connection
URI from a `uri` key, so put it in the same Secret:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: kritika-postgres-app
type: kubernetes.io/basic-auth
stringData:
  username: kritika_app
  password: <password>
  uri: postgres://kritika_app:<password>@kritika-postgres-rw.kritika.svc:5432/kritika?sslmode=require&connect_timeout=10
```

The owner's Secret, `kritika-postgres-credentials`, and the runner's,
`kritika-postgres-runner`, look the same with their own role. A password
generator, such as an External Secrets `Password` generator feeding a
templated `ExternalSecret`, can produce all three, `uri` included; keep the
generated passwords free of characters that need escaping in a URI, or
escape them.

Set `connect_timeout`. Without it a connection attempt waits as long as the
kernel does: after an undeploy and a quick redeploy, a pod's first dial can go
to a Service address that DNS still caches but no longer exists, and that dial
hangs for minutes before kritika retries. With a timeout the attempt fails
fast and the retry looks the name up again.

Point the chart at the three Secrets:

```yaml
database:
  owner:
    existingSecret: kritika-postgres-credentials
  app:
    existingSecret: kritika-postgres-app
  runner:
    existingSecret: kritika-postgres-runner
```

`database.app.role` and `database.runner.role` must name the roles the URIs
log in as, if they are not `kritika_app` and `kritika_runner`.

## Connections

Postgres allows 100 connections unless `max_connections` says otherwise.
Each kritika replica keeps an application pool of up to 16 connections and
an owner pool of up to 4, plus its `LISTEN` connections, and every runner
Job opens a pool of its own, of which it uses one or two. Connections open
on demand, so an idle replica holds few. A `pool_max_conns` in a URI
replaces that pool's ceiling: raise the application pool's if jobs wait on
the pool, which `kritika_db_pool_empty_acquires_total` counts and
`kritika_db_pool_connections` shows against the ceiling
([metrics](metrics.md)), or raise `max_connections` under the Cluster's
`postgresql.parameters` for more replicas. CNPG's
`cnpg_backends_total` metric shows what each `application_name`
(`kritika-app`, `kritika-owner`, `kritika-listen`) holds.

Both pools set a `statement_timeout` on their sessions: one minute on the
application pool, so a slow dashboard query cannot hold the connections
webhooks and jobs need, and ten minutes on the owner pool, for a migration
that builds an index. The leader's hourly retention sweeps of transcripts
and stored diffs work in batches, each its own statement, so a backlog
larger than one statement could clear is worked off over the sweep rather
than rolled back.

Prometheus scrapes CNPG's metrics through a `PodMonitor`. CNPG deprecates the
Cluster's `monitoring.enablePodMonitor` in favor of one you create
([monitoring](https://cloudnative-pg.io/docs/1.30/monitoring/)):

```yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: PodMonitor
metadata:
  name: kritika-postgres
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      cnpg.io/cluster: kritika-postgres
  podMetricsEndpoints:
    - port: metrics
```

## Failover and maintenance

When the primary changes, by a failover or a switchover, kritika's
connections drop and reconnect on their own. The replica that held the leader
lock loses it with its owner connection and steps down, and another takes it
within one `KRITIKA_LEADER_RETRY_INTERVAL`, 15 seconds unless set; until
then the leader's duties and job fetching pause.
No kritika pod restarts.

How fast that happens does not depend on the Cluster's settings. kritika's
pools ask Postgres for TCP keepalives of 30s idle, 10s apart, three missed,
so a kritika pod that dies without closing its sockets loses its session,
and with it the leader lock, within about a minute; the Cluster's own
`tcp_keepalives_*` parameters are not involved. In the other direction, a
primary whose node dies answers nothing, and kritika bounds every ping of an
idle pooled connection and every lock attempt to five seconds, so the leader
steps down within one `KRITIKA_LEADER_RETRY_INTERVAL` plus that bound and a
standby leads once its connections reach the new primary. A switchover
terminates the old primary's sessions outright, so the handover is one
retry interval at most, during which the new leader may start its duties
before the old one has noticed it lost the lock; `KritikaMultipleLeaders`
in the chart's alerts waits longer than one interval for that reason.

CNPG's disruption budget for the primary allows no eviction, so draining the
primary's node waits until the primary moves. Switch over first, with the
[`cnpg` kubectl plugin](https://cloudnative-pg.io/docs/1.30/kubectl-plugin/):

```sh
kubectl cnpg status kritika-postgres -n kritika
kubectl cnpg promote kritika-postgres kritika-postgres-2 -n kritika
```

## Backups

The configuration lives in git and the similar-code index rebuilds on its
own, but reviews, findings, feedback, usage and the audit log exist only in
the database. CNPG backs a cluster up two ways
([backups](https://cloudnative-pg.io/docs/1.30/backup/)):

- **Object storage** through the
  [Barman Cloud plugin](https://cloudnative-pg.io/plugin-barman-cloud/),
  which also archives WAL for point-in-time recovery. The Cluster's native
  `barmanObjectStore` does the same but is deprecated since CNPG 1.26.
- **Volume snapshots** through the storage class's CSI driver
  ([volume snapshots](https://cloudnative-pg.io/docs/1.30/appendixes/backup_volumesnapshot/)),
  with `backup.volumeSnapshot` on the Cluster and a `ScheduledBackup`. They
  stay in the same storage system, and point-in-time recovery still needs a
  WAL archive in object storage.

A replica is not a backup: it copies a mistake as fast as anything else.

Backups hold the roles but not their Secrets, and a restored cluster's roles
keep the passwords they had when the backup was taken
([recovery](https://cloudnative-pg.io/docs/1.30/recovery/)). Name the owner's
Secret in `bootstrap.recovery`, with `database: kritika` and `owner: kritika`,
and CNPG sets the owner's password from it once recovery completes; the
`DatabaseRole`s apply their own Secrets' passwords the same way. kritika's
`uri` keys then match, whether the Secrets were kept or generated anew.
