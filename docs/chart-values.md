# Helm chart values

The **kritika** chart is documented value by value in the generated
[chart README](https://github.com/home-operations/kritika/blob/main/charts/kritika/README.md),
kept in step with `values.yaml` by helm-docs (CI fails if it goes stale). The
chart also ships a
[`values.schema.json`](https://github.com/home-operations/kritika/blob/main/charts/kritika/values.schema.json)
for editor completion and `helm install` validation. The chart README also
covers the egress gateway, runner tools and the runner sandbox; the database
has its own page, [Postgres with CloudNativePG](database.md).

This page is the orientation: which groups of values exist and where their
behavior is explained, followed by the full `values.yaml`.

- **`image`**, **`replicas`**, **`strategy`**, **`resources`** and the pod
  settings: the one Deployment of `kritika serve`.
- **`serviceAccount`**, **`rbac`** and **`podDisruptionBudget`**: its
  ServiceAccount, the Role that lets it create runner Jobs, and, with more
  than one replica, the budget that lets a drain take one at a time.
- **`config`**: every `KRITIKA_*` variable the chart does not derive, keyed
  by its name without the prefix in camelCase: the public URL the dashboard and GitHub's webhooks
  share, logging, the workers, polling, retention, the runner Jobs'
  deadline and RuntimeClass, and the variables that stand in for the
  configuration file's sections, secrets from existing Secrets. See
  [Configuration file](configuration.md).
- **`configFile`** and **`existingConfigMap`**: the configuration file,
  inline or from an existing ConfigMap. See
  [Configuration file](configuration.md).
- **`env`** and **`envFrom`**: the Secrets that set the variables the
  configuration file names. See [Configuration file](configuration.md).
- **`database`**: the Postgres host and the owner, application and runner
  roles' Secrets.
- **`runner`**: the image, ServiceAccount, TTL, resources and tools of the
  runner Jobs.
- **`service`**, **`ingress`** and **`httpRoute`**: the public, metrics and
  gateway ports and how the public one is exposed. The gateway is the egress
  proxy runner pods reach the outside and their model through.
- **`networkPolicy`**: the policies that confine runner pods to the gateway.
- **`monitoring`** and the probes: see [Metrics](metrics.md).
- **`tests`**: the `helm test` pod.
