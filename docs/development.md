# Development

Tool versions and tasks live in [`.mise/config.toml`](https://github.com/home-operations/kritika/blob/main/.mise/config.toml):

```sh
mise install
mise run build
mise run test               # unit tests; mise run test -- ./internal/worker/ runs one package's
mise run test-integration   # Postgres suites against a throwaway VectorChord container
mise run lint
mise run smoke              # kritika serve in a kind cluster with CloudNativePG (needs docker, kind, kubectl, helm, openssl)
```

`mise run smoke` is what CI's Serve Smoke job runs: it builds the image,
creates a kind cluster, installs CloudNativePG and a one-instance Postgres
with VectorChord as an image volume extension and the three roles, installs
the chart with two replicas and waits for both to be ready, runs `helm
test`, and checks that the replicas settle on one leader with the
configuration applied. `KRITIKA_SMOKE_KEEP=1` leaves the cluster running
for a look afterwards, and `KRITIKA_SMOKE_IMAGE` names an image already
built, to skip the build.

## Docs

This site is MkDocs Material, declared in `pyproject.toml`, pinned in
`uv.lock` and run through uv, which mise installs. Pages live in `docs/`, and their order in
`mkdocs.yml`'s `nav`.

```sh
mise run docs-serve   # live preview at http://127.0.0.1:8000/
mise run docs         # build into site/ with --strict, as CI does
```

`--strict` fails the build on a broken link or a page missing from `nav`.
Pull requests into `main` build the site; a push to `main` publishes it to
GitHub Pages.

## Evaluation

Review quality is measured offline: `mise run bench-mine` builds a corpus,
from sibling checkouts of flate and konflate, of pull requests whose lines a
later fix commit changed, and `mise run
bench` (with `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`) runs them through the service's own
fetch, context and prompt code as one-step agentic reviews, what
`agent.steps: 1` sends: the agentic system prompt, the read-only tools
over the head commit and a `submit_review` the one step is told to make. Stage 4, the
similar-code index, needs a database and is left out. Each case runs with
the diff alone and with the context stages, reporting recall on the
expected findings, cost and latency per ablation.

## Cluster development loop

Everything that touches a private cluster lives in the gitignored
`.private/` folder, so account names, secret references and cluster
pointers never enter the repository:

- `.private/deploy`: a kustomization for what the chart does not create
  (namespace, a CloudNativePG cluster with the `vector` extension via a
  CNPG `Database` resource and External Secrets `Password` generators for
  its roles, the bot and provider credentials as ExternalSecrets). It
  expects the CloudNativePG, External Secrets and Prometheus operators.
- `.private/values.yaml`: the chart values for that cluster; `mise run
deploy` installs `charts/kritika` with them and the freshly pushed image,
  so every dev loop exercises the chart.
- `.private/mise.local.toml`: `[env] KUBECONFIG = "..."`, symlinked from
  the repo root as `.mise.local.toml` so mise picks it up.
- `.private/image` and `.private/runner-image`: the last image references
  pushed.

```sh
mise run deploy     # build, push, apply, wait for rollout
mise run logs       # follow one of the deployment's pods
mise run undeploy   # delete everything, database included
```

Images go to the registry `KRITIKA_DEV_REGISTRY` names, or to `ttl.sh` (24h
TTL) when it is unset, under a fresh name on every deploy, so a redeploy
always pulls new code.
The Helm chart is the supported way to run kritika; `.private/deploy` is a
development harness, not an example to copy.
