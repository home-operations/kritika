# Metrics

The management port serves `/metrics` alongside `/healthz` and `/readyz`.
Beyond the Go runtime and process collectors, every series is prefixed
`kritika_`, and none is labelled by pull request or commit. The chart's
`monitoring.serviceMonitor.enabled` creates a Prometheus Operator
`ServiceMonitor` for it.

## Alerts

The chart's `monitoring.prometheusRule.enabled` creates a Prometheus Operator
`PrometheusRule` with the alerts below, grouped by the metrics Service's
`namespace` and `job`. Each one's wait is a value
(`monitoring.prometheusRule.*For`); `additionalRuleLabels` adds a routing
label to every rule, and `additionalRuleAnnotations` an annotation.

| Alert                    | Fires when                                                           | Severity | Wait |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ---- |
| `KritikaNoLeader`        | `sum(kritika_leader) == 0`: no replica holds the leader lock          | critical | 5m   |
| `KritikaMultipleLeaders` | `sum(kritika_leader) > 1`: more than one replica reports holding it   | critical | 2m   |
| `KritikaConfigError`     | `kritika_config_error == 1`: the leader could not apply the file      | warning  | 5m   |
| `KritikaConfigDrift`     | `kritika_config_drift == 1`: a replica's file differs from the applied one | warning | 15m |

Without a leader nothing migrates, applies configuration, polls or rescues
the jobs a dead replica left; a standby takes the lock within one leader
retry interval once its owner connection reaches the database, and Postgres
drops a dead leader's session, and with it the lock, within about a minute.
Two leaders can show for one retry interval through a database failover,
while the old leader's lock connection has not yet failed; longer than that
means the replicas are not on one database. Drift is expected for the
minute or two a rollout takes, until the new pod leads and applies its
file.

## Grafana dashboard

The chart's `monitoring.dashboards.enabled` renders a Grafana dashboard of
most of the series above (`charts/kritika/dashboards/kritika.json`) as a ConfigMap
labelled `grafana_dashboard: "1"` for the kube-prometheus-stack sidecar, or,
with `monitoring.dashboards.grafanaOperator.enabled`, as a `GrafanaDashboard`
for grafana-operator that imports the ConfigMap into the Grafana instance
`grafanaOperator.matchLabels` selects. It is filtered by the metrics
Service's `namespace` and `job`, then by `account` and `model`, and its rows
follow a review's path: health (leaders, configuration, drift, rescued
jobs), intake (webhooks, backstop polls, rate limits), reviews (status,
duration, findings, follow-ups, the wait for a model slot), models (calls,
tokens, cost per hour and over the time range), runner Jobs, the gateway's
egress and the index, and the database pools.
