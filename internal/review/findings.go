// Package review turns a context pack into a prompt, a model answer into
// findings, and findings into the comments kritika posts. It knows nothing
// about forges or models beyond their interfaces.
//
// # Templates
//
// Comments are rendered from Go text/template templates that a repository
// may replace, with the go-sprout/sprout helpers that tuppr and chaski
// expose: the std, strings, conversion, encoding, numeric, slices, maps,
// regex, time, semver and reflect registries, less set and unset. Not
// available: env, filesystem, network, random, uniqueid, checksum and
// crypto, and the template, define and block actions, so a template can
// read no file and call no other template. Rendering is bounded, and a
// template that steps outside a bound falls back to kritika's default with
// a note:
//
//   - output of 64 KiB, marker included;
//   - 20,000 loop iterations per render, charged when a loop starts;
//   - 256 KiB per function call, counting its arguments, its result and,
//     for repeat, indent, nindent, join, replace, regexReplaceAll,
//     regexReplaceAllLiteral, seq, until, untilStep and printf, an estimate
//     of what it allocates; printf refuses a width or precision given as *;
//   - two seconds per render; identifiers starting with __kritika_ are
//     reserved.
//
// The summary template's dot is a RenderData, the inline template's a
// Finding; see templates/ for the defaults.
