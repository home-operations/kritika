// ListenHandlers bundles the callbacks Listen drives. OnEvent and

// synchronously, one at a time, in the order they were queued, from a
// single dedicated goroutine that drains it (see Listen's doc comment) —
// so none of them may block for long: a slow callback delays every
// notification queued behind it. A callback that needs to do slow work
// should hand off to its own goroutine or queue rather than doing it
// inline.
//
// Once the queue is full, a new OnEvent notification is dropped
// (see dropWarner), and OnReconnect is queued in its place, once for a run
// of drops, so consumers re-fetch what the dropped events would have told
// them (see deliver). OnReconnect is treated as more important than any
// single dropped event — a consumer that misses it can go on serving
// stale state indefinitely — so if the queue is full when OnReconnect is
// due, the oldest queued notification is evicted to make room rather than
// losing the reconnect signal itself (see enqueueReconnect).
//
// OnReconnect, if set, is invoked after every successful (re)connect after
// the first — never after Listen's initial connection, only after each one
// that follows a disconnect that got far enough to reach the notification
// loop (i.e. LISTEN itself succeeded). A NOTIFY sent while no listener was
// connected is lost, so consumers use OnReconnect to re-fetch whatever
// state they'd otherwise have learned about incrementally: e.g. the web
