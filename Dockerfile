# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1

# Images that live on Docker Hub are pulled through mirror.gcr.io, Google's
# cache of it, so a build never meets Docker Hub's pull limits. Renovate
# still resolves them on Docker Hub: the shared preset aliases the mirror.

# ARGs used in a FROM must live in the global scope (before the first FROM).
# GO_VERSION and NODE_VERSION are supplied by the release workflow from mise,
# the single source of truth for the toolchain (see .mise/config.toml).

# linux-arm64 platforms as the repository's own lockfile. mise's image has no
# shell to copy the binaries out with, so its static binary and the CA roots
# it downloads with are taken from it instead.

# the tools' release builds, and no shell or package manager, so those
# commands are the only other programs a pod can start.
