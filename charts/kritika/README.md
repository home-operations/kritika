## Usage

kritika ships as an OCI Helm chart. It needs a Postgres with
[VectorChord](https://github.com/tensorchord/VectorChord) and pgvector, three
roles, its public URL, a way to sign in, and its configuration file:

```sh
helm install kritika oci://ghcr.io/home-operations/charts/kritika \
  --set database.app.existingSecret=kritika-postgres-app \
  --set database.owner.existingSecret=kritika-postgres-credentials \
  --set database.runner.existingSecret=kritika-postgres-runner \
  --values my-values.yaml
```

where `my-values.yaml` sets:

```yaml
config:
  webUrl: https://kritika.example.com
  authAdminPassword:
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef: { name: kritika-admin, key: password }
  providersApiKey:
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef: { name: kritika-openrouter, key: api-key }
  defaultsModelsReview: openrouter/vendor/large-model
configFile:
  apps:
    github:
      accounts: [org-1]
      clientId: Iv1.example
      privateKey: { env: GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY }
      webhookSecret: { env: GITHUB_APP_WEBHOOK_SECRET }
# A Secret with the keys GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY and GITHUB_APP_WEBHOOK_SECRET.
envFrom:
  - secretRef:
      name: kritika-bot
ingress:
  enabled: true
  hosts: [{ host: kritika.example.com, paths: [{ path: / }] }]
  tls: [{ hosts: [kritika.example.com], secretName: kritika-tls }]
```

`config` is every `KRITIKA_*` variable, keyed by its name without the
prefix in camelCase (`pollInterval` is `KRITIKA_POLL_INTERVAL`): `webUrl`,
the one public URL, with the dashboard at it and the webhook listener
under it at `/hooks`; logging, the workers, polling, retention and runner
Jobs' deadline and RuntimeClass; and the variables that stand in for the
configuration file's sections, sign-in, one app, one provider, the default
models and the embedder (see
[the configuration reference](https://github.com/home-operations/kritika/blob/main/docs/configuration.md)).
A key left empty sets nothing and kritika's default applies; a secret
takes a `valueFrom` map, like the admin password above, which is the way
into a fresh instance. The chart's Ingress or HTTPRoute must route
`webUrl`'s host.

`configFile` is what is reviewed and how: sign-in (`auth`), the GitHub
`apps`, model `providers`, the `embedding`, the `defaults`, `repositories`
entries keyed `owner/*` or `owner/name`, and `accounts`, with the
`config` variables winning over it. kritika reads it at startup: the pods
carry its checksum, so a change rolls them, and a pod whose file doesn't
load never becomes ready while the ones before it keep serving. Secrets
never go in it: it names environment variables, which `env` and `envFrom`
set from existing Secrets, the way any Kubernetes container's environment
is set. The chart refuses a `KRITIKA_*` variable under `env`, naming its
`config` key, and a `config` key for a variable it derives from its other
values, such as the addresses or the database. The
[setup guide](https://github.com/home-operations/kritika/blob/main/docs/setup.md)
covers creating the GitHub App, and the dashboard's setup checklist shows
what a fresh instance still lacks.

### Database

kritika separates three Postgres roles and refuses to start otherwise: the
**owner** (runs migrations and applies configuration on the leader, must not
be a superuser), the **application** role (`database.app.role`, must not own
the tables so row-level security applies to it) and the **runner** role
(`database.runner.role`, handed to runner Jobs, can only write its own run).
The `vchord` (VectorChord) and `vector` (pgvector, whose types it builds on)
extensions must exist before the first start, and `vchord` must be in
`shared_preload_libraries`.

The owner and application connections must reach Postgres directly, or
through a pooler in session mode. The leader is whichever replica holds a
session advisory lock on its owner connection, and the dashboard's live
updates and the job queue's notifications `LISTEN` on the application
connection. A transaction-mode pooler, such as PgBouncer or a CloudNativePG
`Pooler` with `poolMode: transaction`, hands a session to other clients
between transactions, which breaks both. `kritika_leader` is 1 on the replica
that holds the lock.

[Postgres with CloudNativePG](https://kritika.home-operations.com/database/)
sets this up end to end: a two-instance cluster with VectorChord mounted as
an image volume extension, the extensions through a `Database` resource, the
application and runner roles as `DatabaseRole` resources, the Secrets with
their `uri` key for `database.*.existingSecret`, failover and backups.

### Egress gateway

The kritika serve pods serve a forward proxy on `service.gatewayPort`, and runner Jobs
are handed it as `HTTPS_PROXY` and `HTTP_PROXY`. With `networkPolicy.enabled`,
a runner pod can then reach nothing but DNS, Postgres and that port: its git
fetch and every command it runs go through the gateway, which allows a
destination by hostname only. github.com is always allowed once an app
is declared; `egress.allowHosts` in `configFile` adds the rest
(registries, release APIs), and `egress.credentials` names hosts the gateway
adds a bearer token to when a runner sends it a plain `http://` request, so
the runner never holds the token. The token is a secret reference like any
other in the file:

```yaml
configFile:
  egress:
    allowHosts: [api.github.com, "*.githubusercontent.com", ghcr.io]
    credentials:
      api.github.com: { env: GITHUB_TOKEN }
env:
  GITHUB_TOKEN:
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef: { name: kritika-github-token, key: token }
```

The same port is a runner's model endpoint. kritika serve mints a
token for each run, good for that run until its Job's deadline and revoked
when it ends, and hands it to the pod in place of a provider key; the
gateway answers each step through the account's provider with the key only
kritika serve holds, refuses a step once the run's token budget or the
account's `tokensPerMonth` is spent, and records the step's usage. Provider
endpoints are therefore not in a runner's allowlist. The runner also asks it
once for the review's similar code: the gateway embeds the diff with the
instance's embedder and answers from the repository's index, charging the
embedding to the run. Every review runs through the gateway, so it has no
switch.

### Runner tools

A repository's `agent.commands` lets the model run allowlisted
binaries over a checkout of the head commit: to read a dependency bump's
release notes and compare view with `gh`, fetch anything else with
`curl`, search with `rg` and `fd`, or read JSON and YAML with `jq` and
`yq`. Runner Jobs run on the release's `-tools` image, a distroless image
with all six, pinned by digest like the chart's image; a command is offered only when the runner image has it on
its `PATH`, so an image set in `runner.image` without them offers none.
`gh` signs in with the run's own token, which can read only the
repository under review and public repositories, and an app already
allows `github.com` and `api.github.com` through the gateway. Every other
host `curl` reaches must pass the gateway too, so add the release hosts
and registries to `egress.allowHosts`:

```yaml
configFile:
  egress:
    allowHosts: ["*.githubusercontent.com"]
  repositories:
    org-1/repo-1:
      agent: { commands: [gh, curl, fd, rg] }
```

A command runs without a shell, with an environment of `PATH`, its own
`HOME` and the gateway, `gh` also with the run's read-only token as
`GH_TOKEN`, and the runner makes itself unreadable to it first,
so a command cannot read the runner's credentials from `/proc`. The
`-tools` image has no shell either, and the checkout is written without
execute bits, so `fd -x` or `rg --pre` can start only the six commands. A
runner still parses untrusted content and runs what the model asks: run
runner Jobs under a sandboxed RuntimeClass.

### Runner sandbox

Runner Jobs parse untrusted repository content and run what the model asks of
them. Set `config.runnerRuntimeClass` to a sandboxed runtime
the cluster offers (`gvisor` with runsc, or a Kata class) so a kernel
vulnerability reachable from the pod is contained by the sandbox rather than
the node. It is advised, not required: without it the pod's other bounds
still hold (no long-lived secret, egress by hostname through the gateway,
read-only root, no capabilities), but the container runtime alone separates
it from the node.

Set `runner.resources` too. Without them runner pods are BestEffort, with no
memory limit, so a runaway run presses on its whole node rather than being
killed in its own cgroup. Index and review runs have stayed under 100 MiB of
working set so far, so a `128Mi` request with a `1Gi` limit leaves ample
room:

```yaml
runner:
  resources:
    requests: { cpu: 10m, memory: 128Mi }
    limits: { memory: 1Gi }
```

### Topology

The chart runs one Deployment of `kritika serve`, one replica by default.
Its rolling update surges a new pod and takes the old one down only once the
new one is ready, so a rollout, such as the one a changed `configFile`
starts, keeps one serving on its own: a pod is ready only once its database
answers and it serves webhooks. Every replica serves webhooks and
the dashboard and works jobs, and one holds the leader lock at a time, so
`replicas: 2` keeps one serving while a pod or node is lost; the chart then
adds a PodDisruptionBudget so a drain takes one at a time. Until a lost
replica is back, webhooks are refused; the next poll picks up the pull
requests they missed, though not the mentions, which only a webhook
delivers. Runner pods are the Jobs `kritika serve` creates, one per review and
index run, running `kritika run`. A replica that stops drains its jobs
first; one that dies outright leaves them to the leader, which hands them
back to the queue within a few minutes and deletes the runner Jobs they
left, and a remaining replica works them.

| runner.serviceAccount.create | bool | `true` | Create the runner ServiceAccount: no permissions, no token mounted, and the chart's `imagePullSecrets` so runner Jobs can pull from a private registry. |
| runner.serviceAccount.name | string | `""` | Runner ServiceAccount name; generated from the release name if empty. |
| runner.tools | list | `[]` | Command-line tools a runner pod mounts from an image for the agent's run tool (KRITIKA_RUNNER_TOOLS), each a `name`, a digest-pinned `image`, the `path` of its binaries and the `commands` it provides. Needs Kubernetes 1.33 or newer, which mounts an image volume with a subPath; the chart refuses to render them on an older cluster. |
| runner.ttl | string | `"10m"` | How long a finished Job stays for kubectl before Kubernetes removes it (Go duration); the run row keeps everything the Job knew. |
| securityContext | object | `{"allowPrivilegeEscalation":false,"capabilities":{"drop":["ALL"]},"readOnlyRootFilesystem":true}` | Container securityContext (no privilege escalation, read-only root filesystem, drops ALL capabilities). |
| service.gatewayPort | int | `8082` | Port of the gateway the kritika serve pods run, on the pods and its Service: the forward proxy runner Jobs are handed as `HTTPS_PROXY`, allowing only the hosts the configuration names (github.com once an app is configured, `egress.allowHosts`), so runner pods need no direct internet egress, and the model and similar-code endpoints a runner calls with a per-run token, so no provider key enters a runner pod. |
| service.metricsPort | int | `8081` | Metrics and probe port. |
| service.port | int | `8080` | Public port: the webhooks (`POST /hooks/{app}`) and the dashboard. |
| service.type | string | `"ClusterIP"` | Service type of the public Service. |
| serviceAccount.annotations | object | `{}` | Annotations for the ServiceAccount. |
| serviceAccount.automount | bool | `true` | Automount the API token, which kritika serve needs to create runner Jobs. |
| serviceAccount.create | bool | `true` | Create the ServiceAccount kritika serve runs as. |
| serviceAccount.name | string | `""` | ServiceAccount name; generated from the release name if empty. |
| startupProbe | object | `{"failureThreshold":30,"httpGet":{"path":"/healthz","port":"metrics"},"periodSeconds":2}` | Startup probe, on the metrics port. The liveness and readiness probes wait until it passes, so a pod still opening its listeners is not reported unready; it allows a minute. |
| strategy | object | `{"rollingUpdate":{"maxSurge":1,"maxUnavailable":0},"type":"RollingUpdate"}` | Deployment update strategy. A rolling update that surges one pod and takes none down keeps a replica serving while each is replaced. Helm merges maps, so a switch to `Recreate` also sets `rollingUpdate: null`. |
| terminationGracePeriodSeconds | int | `200` | Grace period for a clean shutdown: kritika serve keeps accepting webhooks, dashboard requests and model steps for 5s while traffic moves off the pod, stops taking jobs and lets running ones finish for up to 100s, then takes up to 90s to hand back the reviews it cut for a retry, and its gateway lets model steps in flight finish for up to 2m. |
| tests.image.pullPolicy | string | `"IfNotPresent"` | `helm test` image pull policy. |
| tests.image.repository | string | `"mirror.gcr.io/curlimages/curl"` | `helm test` connection-pod image; a gcr-mirrored curl, so the test never pulls from Docker Hub. |
| tests.image.tag | string | `"8.22.0@sha256:58adaa4e8dca9c988bae2aba4ab3434a0bb2da16bbe3f92dec39ec7785166777"` | `helm test` image, pinned as `tag@sha256:digest` so Renovate bumps the tag and its digest together. |
| tolerations | list | `[]` | Tolerations for pod scheduling. |
| topologySpreadConstraints | list | `[{"labelSelector":{"matchLabels":{"app.kubernetes.io/instance":"{{ .Release.Name }}","app.kubernetes.io/name":"{{ include \"kritika.name\" . }}"}},"maxSkew":1,"topologyKey":"kubernetes.io/hostname","whenUnsatisfiable":"ScheduleAnyway"}]` | Spread the kritika serve pods across nodes, so with `replicas: 2` a node loss takes one of them: a soft constraint, so a one-node cluster still schedules them. Rendered through `tpl`; empty leaves scheduling to Kubernetes. |
| volumeMounts | list | `[]` | Additional volume mounts on the kritika serve container. |
| volumes | list | `[]` | Additional volumes on the Deployment. |
