Self-hosted AI pull request reviewer for GitHub, backed by Postgres and per-review Kubernetes Jobs

**Homepage:** <https://github.com/home-operations/kritika>

## Usage

kritika ships as an OCI Helm chart. It needs a Postgres with
[VectorChord](https://github.com/tensorchord/VectorChord) and pgvector, three
roles, its public URL, a way to sign in, and its configuration file:

```sh
helm install kritika oci://ghcr.io/home-operations/charts/kritika \
  --set database.app.existingSecret=kritika-postgres-app \
  --set database.owner.existingSecret=kritika-postgres-credentials \
  --set database.runner.existingSecret=kritika-postgres-runner \
  --values my-values.yaml
```

where `my-values.yaml` sets:

```yaml
config:
  webUrl: https://kritika.example.com
  authAdminPassword:
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef: { name: kritika-admin, key: password }
  providersApiKey:
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef: { name: kritika-openrouter, key: api-key }
  reviewModel: openrouter/vendor/large-model
configFile:
  apps:
    github:
      accounts: [org-1]
      clientId: Iv1.example
      privateKey: { env: GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY }
      webhookSecret: { env: GITHUB_APP_WEBHOOK_SECRET }
# A Secret with the keys GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY and GITHUB_APP_WEBHOOK_SECRET.
envFrom:
  - secretRef:
      name: kritika-bot
ingress:
  enabled: true
  hosts: [{ host: kritika.example.com, paths: [{ path: / }] }]
  tls: [{ hosts: [kritika.example.com], secretName: kritika-tls }]
```

`config` is every `KRITIKA_*` variable the chart does not derive from its
other values, keyed by its name without the prefix in camelCase
(`pollInterval` is `KRITIKA_POLL_INTERVAL`): `webUrl`, the one public URL,
with the dashboard at it and the webhook listener under it at `/hooks`;
logging, the workers, polling, retention and runner Jobs' deadline and
RuntimeClass; and the variables that stand in for the configuration file's
sections, sign-in, one app, one provider, the review, confidence and
trigger settings and the embedder (see
[the configuration reference](https://github.com/home-operations/kritika/blob/main/docs/configuration.md)).
A key left empty sets nothing and kritika's default applies; a secret
takes a `valueFrom` map, like the admin password above, which is the way
into a fresh instance. The chart's Ingress or HTTPRoute must route
`webUrl`'s host.

`configFile` is what is reviewed and how: sign-in (`auth`), the GitHub
`apps`, model `providers`, the `embedding`, `egress`, the settings every
repository gets (`review`, `confidence`, `trigger`, `comments`, `agent`),
`repositories` entries keyed `owner/*` or `owner/name`, and `accounts`,
with the `config` variables winning over it.

- kritika reads it at startup: the pods carry its checksum, so a change
  rolls them, and a pod whose file doesn't load never becomes ready while
  the ones before it keep serving.
- Secrets never go in it: it names environment variables, which `env` and
  `envFrom` set from existing Secrets, the way any Kubernetes container's
  environment is set.
- The chart refuses a `KRITIKA_*` variable under `env`, naming its
  `config` key, and a `config` key for a variable it derives from its
  other values, such as the addresses or the database.

The
[setup guide](https://github.com/home-operations/kritika/blob/main/docs/setup.md)
covers creating the GitHub App, and the dashboard's setup checklist shows
what a fresh instance still lacks.

### Database

The chart requires three Postgres roles, and kritika checks them at
start:

| Role        | Values                                                   | What it does                                             | kritika refuses one that                        |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| owner       | `database.owner.existingSecret`                          | runs migrations and applies configuration on the leader  | is a superuser                                  |
| application | `database.app.existingSecret`, `database.app.role`       | serves everything else, under row-level security         | owns a table, is a superuser or has `BYPASSRLS` |
| runner      | `database.runner.existingSecret`, `database.runner.role` | is handed to runner Jobs, and can only write its own run |                                                 |

The `vchord` (VectorChord) and `vector` (pgvector, whose types it builds on)
extensions must exist before the first start, and `vchord` must be in
`shared_preload_libraries`.

The owner and application connections must reach Postgres directly, or
through a pooler in session mode. The leader is whichever replica holds a
session advisory lock on its owner connection, and the dashboard's live
updates and the job queue's notifications `LISTEN` on the application
connection. A transaction-mode pooler, such as PgBouncer or a CloudNativePG
`Pooler` with `poolMode: transaction`, hands a session to other clients
between transactions, which breaks both. `kritika_leader` is 1 on the replica
that holds the lock.

[Postgres with CloudNativePG](https://kritika.home-operations.com/database/)
sets this up end to end: a two-instance cluster with VectorChord mounted as
an image volume extension, the extensions through a `Database` resource, the
application and runner roles as `DatabaseRole` resources, the Secrets with
their `uri` key for `database.*.existingSecret`, failover and backups.

### Security

Runner Jobs parse untrusted content and run what the model asks, so the
chart confines them:

- With `networkPolicy.enabled`, a runner pod reaches nothing but DNS,
  Postgres and the egress gateway kritika serve runs on
  `service.gatewayPort`, which allows what the configuration file's
  `egress` lists and is the runner's only way to its model.
- A runner holds no provider key or App key: only a GitHub token for its
  run, a gateway token and the runner role's database URI.
- `runner.tools` adds programs a review's `agent.commands` may run, from
  their own images; `config.runnerRuntimeClass` puts runner Jobs under a
  sandboxed runtime such as gVisor; `runner.resources` keeps a runaway run
  in its own cgroup.

[Security](https://kritika.home-operations.com/security/) covers the
gateway, runner tools and the sandbox in full.

### Topology

The chart runs one Deployment of `kritika serve`, one replica by default.
Its rolling update surges a new pod and takes the old one down only once the
new one is ready, so a rollout, such as the one a changed `configFile`
starts, keeps one serving on its own: a pod is ready only once its database
answers and it serves webhooks. Every replica serves webhooks and
the dashboard and works jobs, and one holds the leader lock at a time, so
`replicas: 2` keeps one serving while a pod or node is lost; the chart then
adds a PodDisruptionBudget so a drain takes one at a time. Until a lost
replica is back, webhooks are refused; the next poll picks up the pull
requests they missed, though not the mentions, which only a webhook
delivers. Runner pods are the Jobs `kritika serve` creates, one per review,
follow-up and index run, running `kritika run`. A replica that stops drains its jobs
first; one that dies outright leaves them to the leader, which hands them
back to the queue within a few minutes and deletes the runner Jobs they
left, and a remaining replica works them.

| monitoring.dashboards.enabled | bool | `false` | Render the Grafana dashboard ConfigMap (for the kube-prometheus-stack sidecar or grafana-operator): kritika's health, intake, reviews, model spend, runner Jobs and database pools, from the metrics the ServiceMonitor scrapes. |
| monitoring.dashboards.grafanaOperator.allowCrossNamespaceImport | bool | `true` | Allow a Grafana in any namespace to import this GrafanaDashboard. |
| monitoring.dashboards.grafanaOperator.enabled | bool | `false` | Render a GrafanaDashboard CR (grafana-operator) referencing the ConfigMap, instead of relying on the sidecar label. |

| monitoring.prometheusRule.enabled | bool | `false` | Create a Prometheus Operator PrometheusRule with kritika's alerts (requires its CRDs): no leader, more than one leader, a configuration the leader could not apply, and a replica whose configuration file drifted from the applied one. |
| monitoring.prometheusRule.labels | object | `{}` | PrometheusRule labels. |
| monitoring.prometheusRule.multipleLeadersFor | string | `"2m"` | How long more than one replica may report the lock before KritikaMultipleLeaders fires. A database failover can show two for one leader retry interval. |
| monitoring.prometheusRule.noLeaderFor | string | `"5m"` | How long no replica may hold the leader lock before KritikaNoLeader fires. A standby takes the lock within one leader retry interval of the database answering, and a dead leader's session is dropped by Postgres within about a minute. |

| podDisruptionBudget.minAvailable | string | `""` | Minimum pods that must stay available, as a count or percentage. Used unless `maxUnavailable` is set. |
| podLabels | object | `{}` | Labels added to the pods. |

| priorityClassName | string | `""` | PriorityClass for the pods. Empty uses the cluster default. |
| rbac.create | bool | `true` | Create the Role and RoleBinding kritika serve needs: Jobs in the release namespace, their pods and logs, and the Secrets it hands them. Nothing cluster-wide. |
| readinessProbe | object | `{"httpGet":{"path":"/readyz","port":"metrics"},"periodSeconds":10}` | Readiness probe, on the metrics port. A replica is ready once its configuration file has loaded, the database answers and it serves webhooks and the dashboard, so a rollout takes the previous pod down only once the new one can hold a delivery. |
| replicas | int | `1` | Replicas of kritika serve. Every replica serves webhooks and the dashboard and works jobs; exactly one holds the leader lock at a time. A rollout keeps one serving on its own; set 2 for one to keep serving while a pod or node is lost. |
| resources | object | `{"limits":{"memory":"512Mi"},"requests":{"cpu":"50m","memory":"128Mi"}}` | Resource requests and limits of the kritika serve pods. |
| runner.image.digest | string | `""` | Pin the runner image by digest (sha256:…); when set, overrides the tag. The release pipeline fills it with the published `-tools` image's digest. |
| runner.image.pullPolicy | string | `"IfNotPresent"` | Runner image pull policy (KRITIKA_RUNNER_IMAGE_PULL_POLICY). |
| runner.image.repository | string | `"ghcr.io/home-operations/kritika"` | Runner image repository. |

| runner.serviceAccount.annotations | object | `{}` | Annotations for the runner ServiceAccount. |
| runner.serviceAccount.create | bool | `true` | Create the runner ServiceAccount: no permissions, no token mounted, and the chart's `imagePullSecrets` so runner Jobs can pull from a private registry. |
| runner.serviceAccount.name | string | `""` | Runner ServiceAccount name; generated from the release name if empty. |
| runner.tools | list | `[]` | Command-line tools a runner pod mounts from an image for the agent's run tool (KRITIKA_RUNNER_TOOLS), each a `name`, a digest-pinned `image`, the `path` of its binaries and the `commands` it provides. Needs Kubernetes 1.33 or newer, which mounts an image volume with a subPath; the chart refuses to render them on an older cluster. |
| runner.ttl | string | `"10m"` | How long a finished Job stays for kubectl before Kubernetes removes it (Go duration); the run row keeps everything the Job knew. |
| securityContext | object | `{"allowPrivilegeEscalation":false,"capabilities":{"drop":["ALL"]},"readOnlyRootFilesystem":true}` | Container securityContext (no privilege escalation, read-only root filesystem, drops ALL capabilities). |
| service.gatewayPort | int | `8082` | Port of the gateway the kritika serve pods run, on the pods and its Service: the forward proxy runner Jobs are handed as `HTTPS_PROXY`, allowing only the hosts the configuration names (github.com once an app is configured, `egress.allow` less `egress.deny`), so runner pods need no direct internet egress, and the model and similar-code endpoints a runner calls with a per-run token, so no provider key enters a runner pod. |
| service.metricsPort | int | `8081` | Metrics and probe port. |
| service.port | int | `8080` | Public port: the webhooks (`POST /hooks/{app}`) and the dashboard. |
| service.type | string | `"ClusterIP"` | Service type of the public Service. |
| serviceAccount.annotations | object | `{}` | Annotations for the ServiceAccount. |
| serviceAccount.automount | bool | `true` | Automount the API token, which kritika serve needs to create runner Jobs. |
| serviceAccount.create | bool | `true` | Create the ServiceAccount kritika serve runs as. |
| serviceAccount.name | string | `""` | ServiceAccount name; generated from the release name if empty. |
| startupProbe | object | `{"failureThreshold":30,"httpGet":{"path":"/healthz","port":"metrics"},"periodSeconds":2}` | Startup probe, on the metrics port. The liveness and readiness probes wait until it passes, so a pod still opening its listeners is not reported unready; it allows a minute. |
| strategy | object | `{"rollingUpdate":{"maxSurge":1,"maxUnavailable":0},"type":"RollingUpdate"}` | Deployment update strategy. A rolling update that surges one pod and takes none down keeps a replica serving while each is replaced. Helm merges maps, so a switch to `Recreate` also sets `rollingUpdate: null`. |
| terminationGracePeriodSeconds | int | `200` | Grace period for a clean shutdown: kritika serve keeps accepting webhooks, dashboard requests and model steps for 5s while traffic moves off the pod, stops taking jobs and lets running ones finish for up to 100s, then takes up to 90s to hand back the reviews it cut for a retry, and its gateway lets model steps in flight finish for up to 2m. |
| tests.image.pullPolicy | string | `"IfNotPresent"` | `helm test` image pull policy. |
| tests.image.repository | string | `"mirror.gcr.io/curlimages/curl"` | `helm test` connection-pod image; a gcr-mirrored curl, so the test never pulls from Docker Hub. |
| tests.image.tag | string | `"8.22.0@sha256:58adaa4e8dca9c988bae2aba4ab3434a0bb2da16bbe3f92dec39ec7785166777"` | `helm test` image, pinned as `tag@sha256:digest` so Renovate bumps the tag and its digest together. |
| tolerations | list | `[]` | Tolerations for pod scheduling. |
| topologySpreadConstraints | list | `[{"labelSelector":{"matchLabels":{"app.kubernetes.io/instance":"{{ .Release.Name }}","app.kubernetes.io/name":"{{ include \"kritika.name\" . }}"}},"maxSkew":1,"topologyKey":"kubernetes.io/hostname","whenUnsatisfiable":"ScheduleAnyway"}]` | Spread the kritika serve pods across nodes, so with `replicas: 2` a node loss takes one of them: a soft constraint, so a one-node cluster still schedules them. Rendered through `tpl`; empty leaves scheduling to Kubernetes. |
| volumeMounts | list | `[]` | Additional volume mounts on the kritika serve container. |
| volumes | list | `[]` | Additional volumes on the Deployment. |
